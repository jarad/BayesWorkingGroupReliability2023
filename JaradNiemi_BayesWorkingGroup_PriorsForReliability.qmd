# Models

## Log-location-scale family

A random variable $T>0$ belongs to a log-location-scale family if
$Y=\log(T)$ is a member of a location-scale family. 

. . . 

The cdf for a log-location-scale distribution is
\begin{align}
\label{equation:lls.cdf}
 F(t;\mu, \sigma)&=\Phi\left [\frac{\log(t)-\mu}{\sigma}
\right ], \,\, t > 0
 \end{align}
 
. . . 
 
and the corresponding pdf is
\begin{align}
\label{equation:lls.pdf}
 f(t;\mu, \sigma)&=\frac{1}{ \sigma t} \phi
\left [
\frac{\log(t)-\mu}{\sigma} \right],
 \end{align}
 
. . .
 
where $\Phi(z)$ and $\phi(z)=d\Phi(z)/dz$ are, respectively,
the cdf and pdf for the underlying location-scale distribution.


## Reparameterization

Often the quantity of interest in reliability is the probability of failure at
a specified time or the failure-time for a specific probability, 
i.e. the $t_p$ quantile. 

. . . 

These are related through the expression
$$t_{p}=\exp[\mu + \Phi^{-1}(p)\sigma].$$

. . . 

This reparameterization has two main benefits:

- prior elicitiation
- reduce correlation in the likelihood


## Censoring

- Exact observations: units have failed and we know when
- Right censoring: units that have not yet failed
    - Time (Type 1) censoring: test ends at a specified time
    - Failure (Type 2) censoring: test ends after X units have failed
- Left censoring: unit has failed, but precise time is unknown
- Interval censoring: failure has occurred with an interval


## Likelihood

For
data consisting of $n$ exact failure times and right-censored observations,
the likelihood is
$$
L(\mu,\sigma) = \prod_{i=1}^{n}
\left\{ \frac{1}{\sigma t_{i}} \, \phi
\left[\frac{ \log(t_{i}) -\mu}{\sigma}
\right]
\right\}^{\delta_{i}}
\times
\left\{1-\Phi \left[\frac{ \log(t_{i}) -\mu}{\sigma}
\right] \right\}^{1-\delta_{i}},
$$
where, for observation $i$, 

- $t_{i}$ is either a failure time or a right-censored time, 
- $\delta_{i}=1$ for an exact failure time, and
- $\delta_{i}=0$ for a right-censored observation.




## Likelihood contours

# Priors

## Priors considered

- Default
    - Jeffreys priors
    - Independent Jeffreys priors 
        - product of conditional Jeffreys priors
    - Reference priors
        - unordered
        - ordered 
- Informative
    - weakly informative
    - informative for one parameter

    
    
## Jeffreys priors

![](include/jeffreys_priors.jpg)

$\zeta_e = [\log(t_e)-\mu]/\sigma$

## Reference priors

![](include/reference_priors.jpg)

$\zeta_e = [\log(t_e)-\mu]/\sigma$


## Type 2 (failure) prior results

- Jeffreys = unordered reference (Kass and Wasserman, 1996)
- Ordered reference = IJ when using shape and scale parameters
- IJ != ordered reference when using $\{\zeta_e,\sigma\}$
- IJ priors invariant to one-to-one monotone reparameterizations


# Posteriors

## Propriety

- Ramos et al. (2020) suggest 2 failures is sufficient for Weibull distribution.
- For computational stability, we needed 3 failures for all distributions.


## Simulation study

5,000 reps of 

- $E[\mbox{events}]$ = 10, 25, 35, 50, 100,
- $p_{fail}$ = 0.01, 0.05, 0.10, 0.50, and
- $\pi(\log(t_{p_{r}}), \sigma)$ = flat and IJ
- Weibull and log-normal distributions

. . . 

Notes:

- Eliminated any simulations with less than 3 failures.
- Used `lsinf` R package to compute elements of the Fisher information matrix.

# Future work

## Future Work

- Coverage conditional on number of failures
- Posterior propriety: 2 v 3 failures
- Computation
    - MCMC (Stan) is overkill for two-parameter distributions
    - Gridding? Importance sampling? Rejection sampling?
- Accelerated failure time priors
    - AFT add explanatory variable(s)
